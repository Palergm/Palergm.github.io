# My first site!
 In my first project i would like to only use:
* HTML
* CSS

# Portifolio
 I created this site to make part of my **Portifolio** because i wanted to test a feel things:
* Website Design
* CSS Design

# How i made it?
 Using VsCode and a lot of **HTML** and *CSS* i was able to test my web design using a really simple code with good technic.
